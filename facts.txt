Some fish have an extra fin on their back: the adipose fin. While its purpose is a mystery, it may have a sensory role.
There are two major families of fish: lobe-finned and ray-finned. Lobe-finned fish have fleshy lobes rather than thin fins, and these are the evolutionary predecessor to limbs.
All vertebrates are technically lobe-finned fish! Coelacanths are evolutionarily closer to vertebrates than any other fish.
Invertibrates are not fish! Molluscs and Anthropods come from a different evolutionary branch!
Mudskippers can breathe air through their skin, and live on land for up to 3 days.
You can buy genetically modified fluorescent fish!
Hagfish and Lampreys are the most basal fish, lacking jaws. They latch onto fish and tear off flesh, and secrete mucus.
There are almost 28,000 known species of fish!
Fish have two primary mwans of swimming: Body fin propulsion, and median fin propulsion. Body fin propulsion is more efficient, while median fin propulsion is more agile.
Most bony fish have swim bladders, air-filled sacs that maintain buoyancy to stay in the water. 
FishBase is a global database of fish, with over 35,000 described subspecies of distinct fish.
